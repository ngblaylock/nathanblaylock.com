<SEO title="Group Sale Tracker" />

Group Sale Tracker is a web application that can be run on a computer, tablet, or mobile phone that helps groups keep track of sales that they make. Imagine a neighborhood yard sale where different families bring in items and mix them together. How would you know how much money each family made? That is what this app solves.

Okay, now that is out of the way, I don't think anyone (including myself) has ever used this. I thought of it as a fun problem to solve, and I really wanted to learn Nuxt.js a little better, so I put them together and came up with this app. Don't get me wrong, I put a lot of effort into the design and concepts of this, but I also developed it knowing that it wouldn't be a big "money-making app". I did spend a lot of time designing it using paper prototypes, then moving it in to Adobe XD before finally developing it.

Instead of writing out what this app does, here is a video of how the app works.

More than anything, this was just a fun pet project that I worked on. I learned a lot not only by using Nuxt.js, but also using client-side storage, and exporting and uploading JSON data.
