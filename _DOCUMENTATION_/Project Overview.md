# Project Overview - nathanblaylock.com

This is the home base application for my projects and serves primarily as my portfolio. This has gone through many iterations over the past few years, and this project houses my design standards and important files.

## Objectives

1. Serves as a portfolio of my work. These projects are primarily personal projects. The only professional projects featured are publicly visible websites. I do not (and cannot) share my SDL applications, as cool as they are.
2. Contains an up-to-date online resume of my work.
3. Houses my Svelte 5 component library that is used in personal applications.
