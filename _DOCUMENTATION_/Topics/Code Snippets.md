# Code Snippets

This repo contains two snippet files, one is a `local.code-snippet` file which is nathanblaylock.com specific, and a `nathanblaylock.code-snippets` file which is intended to be shared with the PACKAGE.

There are some tricky things you can do to auto-install the snippets, but I decided to go with an opt-in snippets file.

When creating component snippets, only auto-add props that are required, or props that are `$bindable` prop.
