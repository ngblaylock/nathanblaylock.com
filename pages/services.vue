            Many businesses struggle to meet their branding needs and implement
            that branding across all their products successfully. I started this
            business because I am able to meet this need due to my experience
            working with branding, graphic design, web development, and
            photography. I also love working with small businesses because of
            the impact I have seen any of these services have on the success of
            the business. So here is a list of the services I provide. You can
            use all of them or none. If you have another idea not mentioned,
            just reach out and I will see what I can do.

            Websites should be customized to fit the company brand and should be
            as unique as the company is. There are multiple technologies to help
            achieve this, but you can be sure of one thing; websites that I
            provide are not built using a website creator software. All websites
            I publish are uniquely built from the ground up, which gives full
            control to the interaction of the website. I take care of all of the
            website hosting and domain name management so the customer never has
            to worry about it.
          </p>
          <p>
            A website is more than just content on the web. There is a lot that
            goes into it under the hood. For example, SEO (search engine
            optimization) ensures that your company stands out among the
            millions of websites on the web. Accessibility is also important to
            help a wide variety of customers in using your website. Regardless
            of your website price, I make sure to implement at least these two
            important features.
          </p>
          <p>
            All websites are also provided with analytics that help us
            understand how customers are interacting with the website. This
            helps direct efforts to any redesign that may come down the road.
            Another thing I help with is connecting website information to
            services like Google My Business and Google Maps, to really help
            your customers find your business quickly and easily.

            Branding is a big subject, but what it boils down to is your
            company&rsquo;s identity. This can include things like logos, color
            schemes, font selections, layout standards, graphics and pattern
            styles, editorial style and more. Coming from a graphic design
            background, creating and implementing branding has always been a big
            part of what I do. Instead of just creating a logo, I take this to
            the next level for you by creating mockups for each brand and show
            how everything ties together.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the customer is satisfied with the brand created, they receive
            a branding packet and branding assets. This helps them or other
            designers know how to tie everything together for branding
            consistency. These branding packets include hi-res logos in multiple
            file formats, color schemes, fonts, layouts and templates, and
            anything else required to keep your company looking
            consistent.&nbsp;

            Already have a brand? Whether you like it how it is or would like to
            make modifications, I am happy to work with that.

            Having authentic photos for your website should be a no-brainer, but
            I am always surprised at how often people look to stock photos for
            their business. Authentic photos of your company with your products
            add so much credit to you that stock photos will never do. In many
            cases, even photos taken by an amateur photographer on a phone are
            still better than a stock photo. When using stock photos, you get a
            general, cookie-cutter image that anyone can use, including your
            competitors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Communicate with images of your company. Show your customers what
            you do or provide rather than writing it out. High-quality photos
            provide your customers with a much more engaging website experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do you have your own photographer in mind? I am happy to work with
            them to match up their creative touch with your personal branding
            and website.

              Why do you do this? Don&rsquo;t you have a full-time job already?
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Yes, and I love my job. I like to do work on the side because it
                helps me get out of my routine at work, and helps me stay sharp.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Why small businesses?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                I like to work with small businesses because they are a lot more
                manageable for a part-time side job. I work in a large business
                and know how much time goes into all the little details.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Do you do any web application development?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Yes, I do some web app development. Web apps can get very
                complicated very quickly, however I do enjoy developing apps. If
                you have an idea, let me know what it is and we can work on
                getting all the details in order.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>What is the turnaround for these projects?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The turnaround time for product delivery can depend on the size
                of the project and the budget. I can push out products very
                quickly, but it may require an increase in budget.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Do you write content for the web pages?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                I do not write any content for the web pages. I have many
                skills, but writing is not one of my strengths. Content owners
                are typically expected to provide content. If my clients
                struggle with writing their own content, I have some connections
                that I can reach out to that would be willing to help.
