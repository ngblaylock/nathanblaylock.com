              I am a creative professional who helps small businesses reach

            <h2>Web Development</h2>
            <p>
              In a digital age, it is important to reach customers through a
              strong web presence. I take pride in building high quality,
              engaging, and user friendly websites for your target audience.
              Each website I build is custom built, so whether you need a single
              page website, or a few dozen pages, I can help.

            <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
            <p>
              A strong brand is important to any size business because it
              provides a cohesive identity and style. Having worked with large
              and small scale businesses, I can help ensure that you have a
              professional and consistent design. Already have a brand? I can
              work with it and suggest improvements.

            <h2>Photography</h2>
            <p>
              Purposeful photos increases trust and communication between a
              business and their clients. Although stock photos can increase
              communication, it can never replace authentic photos. Through well
              planned photo sessions, you will be surprised how authentic photos
              will improve your business.
