        Bingo Caller
      </h1>
      <p>
        This project was initially inspired from an activity where I helped run
        a bingo game. One person called out the numbers, and I wrote the numbers
        called in a word document that was projected for the players to see what
        numbers were called. As I ran the word document, I realized that there
        was a better way that it could work, and it could run by one person.

        I realize that there are about a million different bingo callers out
        there, however this one is free to use, free of ads, and there is no
        personal information that you need to give in order to use it. To me, I
        feel like those are enough reasons to use a program like this. Bingo
        Caller comes with an adjustable timer. You can set it to call a new
        number every set number of seconds. If you do that, then everyone can
        have the chance to play.

        As for the branding, I didnâ€™t spend a lot of time on it, but I thought
        it still turned out pretty good. I went with the font Pacifico. I added
        a little wave to the font, and really liked it. As for the color, purple
        seemed to do the trick. I tried out a few, but liked the vibrance a lot.

        I have had a few people use it, and am glad that they enjoy using it. I
        have a few ideas in the future, such as adding audio, and maybe adding
        in some auto generated cards that the user can print off. We will see if
        I get to that. Really, I just did it because it was a fun project to try
        out.
