In 2019 while I was working for Utah State University, my team was tasked with rewriting the psychology department's website. As the lead developer on the project I worked closely with the communication specialist to determine what was working with the current site, and what needed some help. The process for development followed 4 phases; website critique, information organization, design, and development.

### Critique

During our critique period I learned many key challenges to the current site:

1. The department was having was too many undergraduate student candidates applying, and not enough high quality graduate student candidates applying. 
2. The website was not geared toward students, but rather to community members looking for services. There was another website recently created to handle those community services, so this old site really just had similar information. 
3. The department lacked high quality images. Most images were stock images, and usually didn't contribute value to the site content. 


### Information Organization

We started out with an outline of the content. This was a simple document with mostly a large bulleted list of items we wanted to cover. As we refined this top-level content, we began to fill in more detailed content, like what images we thought would support the written content, or anything that we could call out on the page for the user to easily scan and find. Later in the process the communication specialist worked closely with the subject matter experts to get detailed information on their respective sections. As we drew in closer to what content we needed, the design phase started up.

### Design

The design phase didn't take too much effort since we had a strong component library provided by the university for us to use. I used pre-built Adobe XD component library that I had made for other projects and arranged the content for each page. XD was also helpful in prototyping out my designs so I could put it out in front of stakeholders and demonstrate the functionality. We were also able to take a variety of purposeful photos and create custom graphics for the site, which dramatically improved the overall design. After completing the design and getting it signed off by the key stakeholders, we moved on to development.

### Development

Developing a site that is already designed is my recommendation. Development usually seems to take some people the longest time to complete, but I have found that developing a site based off of a refined mockup and prototype takes only a few days. In two short working days I had 95% of the site done, with the remaining just a few details that needed some attention from specific people. Soon after beginning this phase we were able to publicly launch the site.

### Outcome

The stakeholders were thrilled with the final product and also passed on some very encouraging feedback they had received as well. The project was a smashing success in both delivery time and in addressing the issues we had found in the critique phase.
