Another thing he had going for him is that he\n      started early in his business to get his branding in order, and he had a\n      good vision for what he wanted his brand to be. First, Wayne needed was\n      a logo. He sent over some clipart and put words around it. He had a\n      general idea for what he wanted his brand to be but wasn’t able to\n      execute it himself.
