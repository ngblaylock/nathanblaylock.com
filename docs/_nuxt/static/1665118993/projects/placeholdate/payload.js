The Figma community has a lot of extensions that can add in a variety of placeholder data, such as words, sentences, paragraphs, names, addresses, images, and so on. Plugins have been a crucial part of my interface design process by quickly mocking up ideas for my customers, but there was one area that I could not find a suitable solution. As many plugins as there were, none of them really handled date data the way I needed. Unlike sentences or names, dates have so many options on how to display it. Do you write 2022-02-01 or February 1, 2022 or Feb. 01, 2022? I decided to solve that issue."}]},{type:a,value:b},{type:c,tag:e,props:{src:"\u002Fimg\u002Fprojects\u002Fplaceholdate\u002FPlaceholdPlusDateEqPlaceholdate.png",alt:"Placehold + Date = Placeholdate"},children:[{type:a,value:b}]},{type:a,value:b},{type:c,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Figma has an awesome guide for developing plugins.

The development experience was somewhat difficult to work with. What it takes is two files. One is the typescript file which transpiles to JavaScript connecting your plugins UI to Figma, and another is a very basic html file for the UI. This is normally fine, but when you have to shove all of your CSS, HTML, and JavaScript into one file, it can get long and messy very fast. What I did was created my own build tool that will watch for changes in specific files and will generate the HTML UI for me. Taking this one step further, I was also able to write all of my CSS in Sass which is always so much easier. Now instead of managing 1 extremely large file, I can write my app out in different files and formats and have it immediately compile itself.
