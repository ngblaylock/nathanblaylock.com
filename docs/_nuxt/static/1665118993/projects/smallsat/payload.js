If you have seen my other projects you will know that I am a huge fan of Bootstrap. One of the main complaints about Bootstrap is that all websites that use it look the same. But, if you take the source Sass files, you can easily change just a few variables and your site will really take shape to something very different. The other reason I like Bootstrap is that they have a simple naming convention, a thorough grid system, and an amazing list of utility classes. Combining these features makes modifying a website style every year a breeze."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Another particular challenge we faced with SmallSat was the COVID-19 pandemic.
