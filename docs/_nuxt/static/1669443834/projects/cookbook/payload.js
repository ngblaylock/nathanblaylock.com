I had decided a long time ago that I didn't want to use a physical recipe book because if I was traveling and needed a recipe, I didn't know what it was. Or if I had made something I particularly liked and was telling a friend about it, I couldn't share that with them as a link. I was interested in developing a real web application and decided that this would work really well for a beginner project."}]},{type:a,value:b},{type:c,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"I had learned Nuxt pretty well and decided that was what I wanted to use for my front end framework. I also needed a way to save data in a database. I didn't know server management very well and didn't want to set up a super robust system where I would be the only user of the app, so I decided to use Firebase. I had done some tutorials and tests before starting the app and really liked it. After a quick design in Sketch and with my list of requirements, I set out to develop my first real web application."}]},{type:a,value:b},{type:c,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"I found a really neat module for Nuxt that allows you to integrate Firebase easily.

I made sure that the website would work well for a mobile screen. I also found that you can create a shortcut for the app to your mobile device screen, and when the page opens, it doesn't include the Safari search bar. That was really what I was going for. Adding in a simple icon with a specific name let my device know what image to use for the app icon."}]},{type:a,value:b},{type:c,tag:e,props:{src:"\u002Fimg\u002Fprojects\u002Fcookbook\u002Fcookbook-icon.png",alt:"Cookbook App Icon",width:200},children:[{type:a,value:b}]},{type:a,value:b},{type:c,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"On the surface, what you can see is a list of recipes listed in alphabetical order.
