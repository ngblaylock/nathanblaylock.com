The marketing team at SDL got the go-ahead to redesign the company website and began research and designing. As the primary UX\u002FUI designer on other projects, I was able to help guide the marketing team to create a top-notch design that would work well as an online format. As part of guiding the design, I also trained the designers to use Figma, which is a fantastic tool for mockups and prototypes."}]},{type:a,value:b},{type:c,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"My role in gathering content and doing user research was pretty minimal.
