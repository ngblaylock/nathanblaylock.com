There were a few good things going for his business. First thing is that Wayne had a unique business name. Because of this, he didn’t have any issues getting a good website domain; busybeeoddjobs.com. Another thing he had going for him is that he started early in his business to get his branding in order, and he had a good vision for what he wanted his brand to be. First, Wayne needed was a logo. He sent over some clip art and put words around it. He had a general idea for what he wanted his brand to be but wasn’t able to execute it himself. I had drawn up a few sketches for a logo and really liked the end result."}]},{type:a,value:b},{type:c,tag:e,props:{src:"\u002Fimg\u002Fprojects\u002Fbusy-bee-odd-jobs\u002FBBOJ-old-new.png",style:"mix-blend-mode: multiply;"},children:[{type:a,value:b}]},{type:a,value:b},{type:c,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"It is always fun to insert something subtle into a logo, similar to the famous FedEx arrow.

Wayne and I brainstormed a good hero statement “You have the jobs. We have the manpower.” We added a call to action, which is to hire Wayne, and continued by sharing what services he offered. We decided to have a little fun with showing some projects that Wayne took on, and used a “before and after” slider, so the users can get an interactive experience. Of course, we needed a testimonial and a contact form. To add a cherry on top of the website, we added some animation to help improve the customer’s interest."}]},{type:a,value:b},{type:c,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"I had used 11ty for some other projects and really liked it for a simple static site that has very little interactivity.
