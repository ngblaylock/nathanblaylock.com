There were a few good things going for his business. First\n      thing is that Wayne had a unique business name. Because of this, he\n      didn’t have any issues getting a good website domain;\n      busybeeoddjobs.com. Another thing he had going for him is that he\n      started early in his business to get his branding in order, and he had a\n      good vision for what he wanted his brand to be. First, Wayne needed was\n      a logo. He sent over some clipart and put words around it. He had a\n      general idea for what he wanted his brand to be but wasn’t able to\n      execute it himself. I had drawn up a few sketches for a logo and really\n      liked the end result.\n    ")]),e._v(" "),o("img",{staticClass:"d-block mx-auto mb-3 img-fluid",attrs:{src:"/img/projects/bboj/BBOJ-old-new.png",alt:""}}),e._v(" "),o("p",[e._v("\n      It is always fun to insert something subtle into a logo, similar to the\n      famous FedEx arrow.

Although it is\n      not the full name of the business, it is part of it and helps tie in the\n      logo to the brand.\n    ")]),e._v(" "),o("img",{staticClass:"d-block mx-auto mb-3 img-fluid",attrs:{src:"/img/projects/bboj/BBOJ-odd.png",alt:""}}),e._v(" "),o("p",[e._v("\n      In the initial logo concept that Wayne provided, he had a somewhat rough\n      font.

Wayne and I\n      brainstormed a good hero statement “You have the jobs. We have the\n      manpower.” We added a call to action, which is to hire Wayne, and\n      continued by sharing what services he offered. We decided to have a\n      little fun with showing some projects that Wayne took on, and used a\n      “Before and After” slider, so the users can get an interactive\n      experience.
